# 🪙 Crypto Arbitrage Bot

A real-time cryptocurrency arbitrage bot written in Python that monitors bid/ask spreads across major exchanges and logs spread data for analysis. Built using [CCXT](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt) and designed with modular components to support future trade execution and backtesting.

## 🚀 Features

- Fetches live order books from Binance and Kraken
- Logs raw bid/ask and mid-price spreads to CSV
- Computes "tradable" spreads between exchanges
- Separate logging modes for raw mid-prices and tradable opportunities
- Asynchronous-ready structure and configurable polling interval
- Sandbox mode enabled for Binance (safe testing)

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python 3.10+
- [CCXT](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt)
- `asyncio`, `csv`, `pandas`, `numpy`
- `python-dotenv` for credential management
